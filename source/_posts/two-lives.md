Project:
**Two Lives: A Generative Audiovisual Installation Exploring Algorithmic Composition Through Concatenative Synthesis, L-System, and the Visualisation of Artificial and Natural Life**

This work is a audiovisual installation themed on “life”, composed of two independently running sub-modules: artificial life and natural life. The artificial life module features an alife-based visual, together with a concatenative synthesiser. The natural life module consists of a Max patcher (presenting video of human fertilised eggs and generating melodies) and an Ableton project (receiving MIDI notes from Max to drive instrumental performance). Each sub-module is equipped with an interaction tool, allowing the audience to manipulate sound and visuals in real time through hand gestures. At the same time, internal interconnections exist within each module: In artificial life, visuals directly influence sound generation in real time; In natural life, sound drives changes in the visual effects.
